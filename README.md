Source Code: https://github.com/bearlikelion/godot-xr-gamejam

Entry for the [Godot XR Game Jam - Feb 2025](https://itch.io/jam/godot-xr-game-jam-feb-2025), theme: Enchanted

We suggest you play with a stationary boundary where you can spread your arms out in all directions.

Recommend to play through **PC VR** or on a **Quest 3/3s**, work was done to improve native performance on the Quest 2 but there is only so much time in 7 days.

## Controls:

* Use the **grip** to grab objects with your wizard powers
* Press **A/X** to repeat instruction
* Press **B/Y** to restart the level

***A VR headset is not required to play.***

* You can also control the camera with your mouse.
* Left hand with Q | Right hand with E
* Hold shift+hand to turn hand
* Hold hand + mouse wheel to move hand in / out
* Left click for trigger, Right click for grip
* Q/E + 1 to restart level
